I am currently looking for PostDoc Opportunities!
=======

Welcome! My name is Dandan Zhang. I am a PhD student working with [Randall Martin](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/) in the [Department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering](https://eece.wustl.edu/index.html) at Washington University in St. Louis.

My research focuses on the application and development of air quality modeling in combination with ground-based and satellite obseravtions. I have been working on the effects of model spatial resolution on population exposure to air pollutants, source sectors contributions, and satellite-derived geophysical fine particulate matter. I am also interested in model development, and currently working on improving mineral dust simulations in a chemical transport model [GEOS-Chem](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html).

Prior to my PhD, I received a B.S. in Environmental Sciences and a B.A. in Economics at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (Beijing, China) in 2019. My undergraduate research was advised by [Wen Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ArwW7qgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) with a focus on the degradation processes of trace antibiotics in polluted aquatic system by engineered photocatalysts under simulated sunlight.

Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, swimming, skiing, and skating.
